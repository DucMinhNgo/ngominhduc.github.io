Hello! I’m Duc, an IT professional with a passion for technology and innovation.
With a background in [Backend (Nodejs, Nestjs), Frontend (Reactjs, Nextjs,
Nuxtjs), Gcp, Docker (image, container, hub, volumes), Training some model], I
thrive on solving complex problems and creating efficient solutions.

In this blog, I share insights, tips, and tutorials on various IT topics,
including [Code, Algorithm, Program]. My goal is to help fellow tech enthusiasts
and professionals stay updated, enhance their skills, and navigate the
ever-evolving tech landscape.

When I’m not immersed in code or configuring networks, you can find me
[swimming, running, exploring new tech gadgets, gaming, hiking]. I’m always
eager to learn new things and take on exciting projects.

Thank you for visiting my blog. Let’s connect and grow together in the world of
technology!

[`minima` theme][minima]. This repo has what I consider the minimum pieces for a
personal blog using [Jekyll][jk] and [Github Pages][gh-site].

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further
details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how
Github Pages work.
